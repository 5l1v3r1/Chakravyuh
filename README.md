Multiple Defense Sandbox
	
	Pluggable Agent Based Automated Analysis System for sample execution and log comparison.
	Currently Supporting EMET and MBAE configuration (public) for exploit detection
	Can be used for private agents
	Features : -
		Multiple Agent Based detection check for untrusted program (kinda like VT with dynamic execution)
		Pluggable Architecture
		Behavioural profiling of Sample (based on Agent)
		Comparing detection across multiple defensive products
	
Concept is similar to virustotal, multiple defensive layers provide more protection (probably).
